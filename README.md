# Minesweeper Game

A classic Minesweeper implementation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

The objective is to reveal all cells on the board that don't contain mines while avoiding clicking on any mines.

### Basic Rules

1. **Left-click** on a cell to reveal it
2. **Right-click** on a cell to flag it as a potential mine
3. Numbers on revealed cells indicate how many mines are adjacent to that cell
4. Empty cells (no adjacent mines) will automatically reveal neighboring empty areas
5. You have **3 lives** - hitting a mine costs you one life
6. Game ends when you either:
   - Hit 3 mines (Game Over)
   - Reveal all non-mine cells (You Win!)

### Special Features

- **First Click Safety**: Your first click will never be a mine
- **Auto-Expand**: Clicking empty cells automatically reveals connected empty areas
- **Lives System**: Get 3 chances instead of instant game over
- **Visual Feedback**: Revealed and unrevealed cells have different appearances

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Choose a difficulty level or start with Easy (4x4, 2 mines)
3. Click any cell to begin!

## Difficulty Levels

## Controls
